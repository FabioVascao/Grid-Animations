# Grid-Animations

Stage03 Challenge that is part of Rocketseat's Explorer Program <br/>

The idea now is to create Space Cream in the Desktop version! ðŸš€ <br/>

Pay attention to the content that was taught in class. So, in this challenge, remember to use: <br/>

- Grid;
- Animations and transitions, as seen in class;
- Medium queries.
